Real-time Pedestrian Detection using OpenCV 🚶‍♂️🚦
Overview
This project implements real-time pedestrian detection using OpenCV’s HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptor and a pre-trained SVM model. It processes video streams frame by frame, detecting pedestrians and marking them with bounding boxes.

Features
✅ Real-time pedestrian detection using HOG + SVM.
✅ Frame-by-frame video processing for smooth tracking.
✅ Grayscale conversion for efficient computation.
✅ Bounding box visualization for detected pedestrians.
✅ Customizable parameters for accuracy tuning.
